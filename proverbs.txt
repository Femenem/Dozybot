First things first
Fish always stink from the head down
Fish and guests smell after three days
Flattery will get you nowhere
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
For everything there is a season
For want of a nail the shoe was lost; for want of a shoe the horse was lost; and for want of a horse the man was lost
Forewarned is forearmed
Forgive and forget
Fortune favours the brave
From the sublime to the ridiculous is only one step

Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned
Hindsight is always twenty-twenty
History repeats itself
Home is where the heart is
Honesty is the best policy
Hope springs eternal
Horses for courses
If anything can go wrong, it will
If a job is worth doing it is worth doing well
If at first you don't succeed try, try and try again
If God had meant us to fly he'd have given us wings
If ifs and ands were pots and pans there'd be no work for tinkers

Ignorance is bliss
Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery
In for a penny, in for a pound
In the kingdom of the blind the one eyed man is king
In the midst of life we are in death
Into every life a little rain must fall
It ain't over till the fat lady sings
It goes without saying
It is best to be on the safe side
It is better to give than to receive
It is easy to be wise after the event
It never rains but it pours
It takes a thief to catch a thief
It takes all sorts to make a world
It takes one to know one
It takes two to tango
It's all grist to the mill
It's an ill wind that blows no one any good
It's better to give than to receive
It's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
It's better to light a candle than curse the darkness
It's better to travel hopefully than to arrive
It's never too late
It's no use crying over spilt milk
It's no use locking the stable door after the horse has bolted
It's the early bird that catches the worm
It's the empty can that makes the most noise
It's the singer not the song
It's the squeaky wheel that gets the grease
Jack of all trades, master of none
Judge not, that ye be not judged
Keep your chin up
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Keep your powder dry
Laugh and the world laughs with you, weep and you weep alone
Laughter is the best medicine
Least said, soonest mended
Less is more
Let bygones be bygones
Let not the sun go down on your wrath
Let sleeping dogs lie
Let the buyer beware
Let the dead bury the dead
Let the punishment fit the crime
Let well alone
Life begins at forty
Life is just a bowl of cherries
Life is what you make it
Life's not all beer and skittles
Lightning never strikes twice in the same place
Like father, like son
Little pitchers have big ears
Little strokes fell great oaks
Little things please little minds
Live and learn
Live for today for tomorrow never comes
Look before you leap
Love of money is the root of all evil
Love is blind
Love makes the world go round
Love thy neighbour as thyself
Love will find a way
Make hay while the sun shines
Make love not war
Man does not live by bread alone
Manners maketh man
Many a little makes a mickle
Many a mickle makes a muckle
Many a true word is spoken in jest
Many are called but few are chosen
Many hands make light work
March comes in like a lion, and goes out like a lamb
March winds and April showers bring forth May flowers
Marriages are made in heaven
Marry in haste, repent at leisure
Might is right
Mighty oaks from little acorns grow
Misery loves company
Moderation in all things
Monday's child is fair of face,
Tuesday's child is full of grace,
Wednesday's child is full of woe,
Thursday's child has far to go,
Friday's child is loving and giving,
Saturday's child works hard for its living,
And a child that's born on the Sabbath day
Is fair and wise and good and gay.
Money doesn't grow on trees
Money is the root of all evil
Money isn't everything
Money makes the world go round
Money talks
More haste, less speed
Music has charms to soothe the savage breast
Nature abhors a vacuum
Necessity is the mother of invention
Needs must when the devil drives
Ne'er cast a clout till May be out
Never give a sucker an even break
Never go to bed on an argument
Never judge a book by its cover
Never let the sun go down on your anger
Never look a gift horse in the mouth
Never put off until tomorrow what you can do today
Never speak ill of the dead
Never tell tales out of school
Nine tailors make a man
No man can serve two masters
No man is an island
No names, no pack-drill
No news is good news
No one can make you feel inferior without your consent
No pain, no gain
No rest for the wicked
Nothing new under the sun
Nothing is certain but death and taxes
Nothing succeeds like success
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
Oil and water don't mix
Old soldiers never die, they just fade away
Once a thief, always a thief
Once bitten, twice shy
One good turn deserves another
One half of the world does not know how the other half lives
One hand washes the other
One man's meat is another man's poison
One might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb
One law for the rich and another for the poor
One swallow does not make a summer
One volunteer is worth ten pressed men
One year's seeding makes seven years weeding
Only fools and horses work
Opportunity never knocks twice at any man's door
Out of sight, out of mind
Parsley seed goes nine times to the Devil
Patience is a virtue
Pearls of wisdom
Penny wise and pound foolish
People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones
Physician, heal thyself
Possession is nine points of the law
Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely
Practice makes perfect
Practice what you preach
Prevention is better than cure
Pride goes before a fall
Procrastination is the thief of time
Put your best foot forward
Rain before seven, fine before eleven
Red sky at night shepherd's delight; red sky in the morning, shepherd's warning
Revenge is a dish best served cold
Revenge is sweet
Rob Peter to pay Paul
Rome wasn't built in a day
See a pin and pick it up, all the day you'll have good luck; see a pin and let it lie, bad luck you'll have all day
See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil
Seeing is believing
Seek and ye shall find
Set a thief to catch a thief
Share and share alike
Shrouds have no pockets
Silence is golden
Slow but sure
Softly, softly, catchee monkey
Spare the rod and spoil the child
Speak as you find
Speak softly and carry a big stick
Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me
Still waters run deep
Strike while the iron is hot
Stupid is as stupid does
Success has many fathers, while failure is an orphan
Take care of the pence and the pounds will take care of themselves
Talk is cheap
Talk of the Devil, and he is bound to appear
Tell the truth and shame the Devil
That which does not kill us makes us stronger
The age of miracles is past
The apple never falls far from the tree
The best defence is a good offence
The best is the enemy of the good
The best-laid schemes of mice and men gang aft agley
The best things in life are free
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
The bottom line is the bottom line
The boy is father to the man
The bread always falls buttered side down
The child is the father of the man
The cobbler always wears the worst shoes
The course of true love never did run smooth
The customer is always right
The darkest hour is just before the dawn
The devil finds work for idle hands to do
The devil looks after his own
The early bird catches the worm
The end justifies the means
The exception which proves the rule
The female of the species is more deadly than the male
The fruit does not fall far from the tree
The good die young
The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence
The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world
The husband is always the last to know
The labourer is worthy of his hire
The law is an ass
The leopard does not change his spots
The longest journey starts with a single step
The more the merrier
The more things change, the more they stay the same
The only good Indian is a dead Indian
The opera ain't over till the fat lady sings
The pen is mightier than sword
The price of liberty is eternal vigilance
The proof of the pudding is in the eating
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
The shoemaker's son always goes barefoot
The squeaking wheel gets the grease
The truth will out
The wages of sin is death
The way to a man's heart is through his stomach
The whole is greater than the sum of the parts
There are more ways of killing a cat than choking it with cream
There are none so blind as those, that will not see
There are two sides to every question
There but for the grace of God, go I
There's a time and a place for everything
There's an exception to every rule
There's always more fish in the sea
There's honour among thieves
There's many a good tune played on an old fiddle
There's many a slip 'twixt cup and lip
There's more than one way to skin a cat
There's no accounting for tastes
There's no fool like an old fool
There's no place like home
There's no smoke without fire
There's no such thing as a free lunch
There's no such thing as bad publicity
There's no time like the present
There's none so blind as those who will not see
There's none so deaf as those who will not hear
There's nowt so queer as folk
There's one born every minute
There's safety in numbers
They that sow the wind, shall reap the whirlwind
Third time lucky
Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it
Those who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones
Those who sleep with dogs will rise with fleas
Thou shalt not kill
Time and tide wait for no man
Time flies
Time is a great healer
Time is money
Time will tell
'tis better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all
To err is human; to forgive divine
To every thing there is a season
To the victor go the spoils
To travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive
Tomorrow is another day
Tomorrow never comes
Too many cooks spoil the broth
Truth is stranger than fiction
Truth will out
Two blacks don't make a white
Two heads are better than one
Two is company, but three's a crowd
Two wrongs don't make a right
Variety is the spice of life
Virtue is its own reward
Walls have ears
Walnuts and pears you plant for your heirs
Waste not want not
What can't be cured must be endured
What goes up must come down
What you lose on the swings you gain on the roundabouts
What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander
When in Rome, do as the Romans do
When the cat's away the mice will play
When the going gets tough, the tough get going
When the oak is before the ash, then you will only get a splash; when the ash is before the oak, then you may expect a soak
What the eye doesn't see, the heart doesn't grieve over
Where there's a will there's a way
Where there's muck there's brass
While there's life there's hope
Whom the Gods love die young
Why keep a dog and bark yourself?
Women and children first
Wonders will never cease
Work expands so as to fill the time available
Worrying never did anyone any good
You are never too old to learn
You are what you eat
You can choose your friends but you can't choose your family
You can have too much of a good thing
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink
You can't have your cake and eat it
You can't get blood out of a stone
You can't make a silk purse from a sow's ear
You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs
You can't make bricks without straw
You can't run with the hare and hunt with the hounds
You can't teach an old dog new tricks
You can't judge a book by its cover
You can't win them all
You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar
You pays your money and you takes your choice
You reap what you sow
You win some, you lose some
Youth is wasted on the young
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link
A change is as good as a rest
A drowning man will clutch at a straw.
A fair day's work for a fair day's pay
A fool and his money are soon parted
A friend in need is a friend indeed
A golden key can open any door
A good beginning makes a good ending.
A good man is hard to find
A house divided against itself cannot stand
A house is not a home
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step

A little of what you fancy does you good
A man who is his own lawyer has a fool for his client
A man with a hammer sees every problem as a nail

A woman's place is in the home
A man works from sun to sun but a woman's work is never done,
A word to the wise is enough,
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
Accidents will happen (in the best-regulated families)
Actions speak louder than words.

All that glitters is not gold,
All the world loves a lover
All things come to those who wait
All things must pass
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,
All you need is love
All is fair in love and war
All is for the best in the best of all possible worlds
All is well that ends well
An apple a day keeps the doctor away
An army marches on its stomach.
An Englishman's home is his castle
Another day, another dollar.
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
Any port in a storm,
Any publicity is good publicity
April showers bring forth May flowers,
As you make your bed, so you must lie upon it
As you sow so shall you reap
Ask a silly question and you will get a silly answer
Ask my companion if I be a thief
Ask no questions and hear no lies
Attack is the best form of defense
Bad news travels fast
Barking dogs seldom bite,
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
Beauty is only skin deep,
Beggars should not be choosers,
Behind every great man, there is a great woman
Better late than never
Better safe than sorry
Better the Devil you know than the Devil you do not
Better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
Better to light one candle than to curse the darkness
Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt
Better wear out than rust out.

It is the empty can that makes the most noise
It is the squeaky wheel that gets the grease
It never rains but it pours
It takes a thief to catch a thief
It needs a Hundred Lies to cover a Single Lie
It takes all sorts to make a world
It takes one to know one
It takes two to tango
I'm going to have to give you the pink slip
Jack of all trades, master of none
Jack of all trades, master of some
Judge not, that ye be not judged.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.
Trust in God and keep your powder dry
Kindness in words creates confidence. Kindness in thinking creates profoundness. Kindness in giving creates love.
Knowledge is power, guard it well.
Laugh before breakfast, cry before supper.
Laugh and the world laughs with you, weep and you weep alone
Laughter is the best medicine
Least said, soonest mended
Less is more
Let bygones be bygones
Let not the sun go down on your wrath
Let sleeping dogs lie
Let the buyer beware
Let the dead bury the dead
Let the punishment fit the crime
Let well alone
Let your hair down.
Life begins at forty
Life is not all beer and skittles
Life is what you make it
Lightning never strikes twice in the same place
Like father, like son,
Little pitchers have big ears
Little strokes fell great oaks
Little things please little minds
Live and let live
Live for today, for tomorrow never comes
Loose lips, sink ships
Look before you leap
Love is blind
Love of money is the root of all kinds of evil.
Love makes the world go around
Love will find a way
Make hay while the sun shines
Make love not war
Man does not live by bread alone
Manners maketh man
Many a little makes a mickle
Many a mickle makes a muckle
Many a true word is spoken in jest
Many hands make light work
March comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb
Marriages are made in heaven
Marry in haste, repent at leisure
Memory is the treasure of the mind
Men get spoiled by staying, Women get spoiled by wandering
Might is right
Might makes right
Mighty oaks from little acorns grow
Milking the bull
Misery loves company
Moderation in all things
Monday's child is fair of face, Tuesday's child is full of grace, Wednesday's child is full of woe, Thursday's child has far to go, Friday's child is loving and giving, Saturday's child works hard for its living, and a child that is born on the Sabbath day is fair and wise and good and gay.
Money does not grow on trees
Money earned by deceit, goes by deceit
Money is not everything
Money makes the world go around
Money talks
Money makes many things, but also makes devil dance
More haste, less speed
Music has charms to soothe the savage beast
Nature abhors a vacuum,
Never reveal a man's wage, and woman's age
Necessity is the mother of invention
Needs must when the devil drives
Never cast a clout until May be out
Never give a sucker an even break
Never judge a book by its cover
Never let the sun go down on your anger
Never look a gift horse in the mouth
Never put off until tomorrow what you can do today
Never speak ill of the dead
Never say never
Never tell tales out of school
Nine tailors make a man,
No guts, no glory
No man can serve two masters
No man is an island
No names, no pack-drill
No news is good news
No one can make you feel inferior without your consent
No pain, no gain
No rest for the wicked
Nothing is certain but death and taxes
Nothing succeeds like success,
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
Once a witch always a witch
Oil and water do not mix
Old soldiers never die; they just fade away
Once a thief, always a thief
Once bitten, twice shy
One good turn deserves another
One half of the world does not know how the other half lives
One hand washes the other
One man's meat is another man's poison
One might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb
One law for the rich and another for the poor
One swallow does not make a summer
One who believes in Sword, dies by the Sword
One year's seeding makes seven years weeding
Only fools and horses work
Opportunity never knocks twice at any man's door
Out of sight, out of mind
Over greedy man, over wrathful woman will never flourish
Parsley seed goes nine times to the Devil
Patience is a virtue
Pearls of wisdom
Penny wise and pound foolish
People who live in glass houses should not throw stones
Physician, heal thyself
Possession is nine-tenths of the law
Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely
Practice makes perfect
Practice what you preach
Prevention is better than cure
Pride goes before a fall
Procrastination is the thief of time
Put your best foot forward
Put your money where your mouth is
Red sky at night shepherds delight; red sky in the morning, shepherds warning
Revenge is a dish best served cold
Revenge is sweet
Rome was not built in a day,
Right or wrong, my country
See a penny and pick it up, all the day you will have good luck; see a penny and let it lay, bad luck you will have all day
See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil
Seeing is believing
Seek and ye shall find
Set a thief to catch a thief
Shiny are the distant hills
Shrouds have no pockets
Silence is golden
Slow and steady wins the race
Slow but sure
Softly, softly, catchee monkey
Sometimes we are the student.  Sometimes we are the master. And sometimes we are merely the lesson
Spare the rod and spoil the child
Speak as you find
Speak softly and carry a big stick
Speech is silver
Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me
Still waters run deep
Strike while the iron is hot
Stupid is as stupid does
Success has many fathers, while failure is an orphan
Take care of the pennies, and the pounds will take care of themselves
Talk is cheap
Talk of the Devil, and he is bound to appear
Tell me who your friends are, and I'll tell you who you are
Tell the truth and shame the Devil
That which does not kill us makes us stronger
The age of miracles is past
The apple never falls far from the tree
The best defence is a good offence
The best-laid schemes of mice and men often go awry
The best things in life are free
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
The boy is father to the man
The bread never falls but on its buttered side
The child is the father of the man
The cobbler always wears the worst shoes
The course of true love never did run smooth
The customer is always right
The darkest hour is just before the dawn
The devil finds work for idle hands
The Devil looks after his own
The early bird catches the worm
The end justifies the means
The exception which proves the rule
The female of the species is more deadly than the male
The good die young
The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence
The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world
The husband is always the last to know
The innocent seldom find an uncomfortable pillow.
The labourer is worthy of his hire
The leopard does not change his spots
The longest day must have an end
The longest journey starts with a single step
The moon is made of green cheese
The more the merrier
The more things change, the more they stay the same
The only way to understand a woman is to love her
The pen is mightier than the sword
The proof of the pudding is in the eating
The road to Hell is paved with good intentions
The shoemaker's son always goes barefoot
The squeaking wheel gets the grease
The straw that broke the camel's back
The way to a man's heart is through his stomach
There ain't no such thing as a free lunch
There are more ways of killing a cat than choking it with cream
There are none so blind as those that will not see
There are two sides to every question
There but for the grace of God go I
There is an exception to every rule
There are always more fish in the sea
There is honour among thieves
There is many a good tune played on an old fiddle
There is many a slip 'twixt cup and lip
There is more than one way to skin a cat
There is no accounting for tastes
There is no fool like an old fool
There is no place like home
There is no smoke without fire
There is no such thing as a free lunch
There is no such thing as bad publicity
There is no time like the present
There is none so blind as those who will not see
There's none so deaf as those who will not hear
There is nowt so queer as folk
There is one born every minute
There is safety in numbers
They that sow the wind shall reap the whirlwind
Third time is a charm
Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it
Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones
Those who sleep with dogs will rise with fleas
Time and tide wait for no man
Time flies
Time is a great healer
Time is money
Time will tell
’Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
To be worn out is to be renewed.
To each his own.
To err is human, to forgive divine
To the victor go the spoils
To travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive
Tomorrow is another day
Tomorrow never comes
Too many cooks spoil the broth
Truth is stranger than fiction
Truth will out
Two blacks do not make a white
Two heads are better than one
Two is company, but three is a crowd
Two wrongs do not make a right
Variety is the spice of life.
Walk softly but carry a big stick.
Walnuts and pears you plant for your heirs
Waste not, want not
What cannot be cured must be endured
What goes around, comes around
What goes up must come down
What you lose on the swings you gain on the roundabouts
What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
When it rains it pours.
When the cat is away, the mice will play
When the going gets tough, the tough get going
When the oak is before the ash, then you will only get a splash; when the ash is before the oak, then you may expect a soak
When three women gather, it becomes noisy.
What the eye does not see, the heart does not grieve over
Where there is a will there is a way
Where there is muck there is brass
Whether you think you can, or you think you can't, you're right.
While there is life there is hope
Whom the Gods love die young
Why keep a dog and bark yourself?
With a responsibility comes great power
Woman is the root of both good and evil
Wonders will never cease
Work expands so as to fill the time available
Worrying never did anyone any good
You ain't seen nothing yet
You are never too old to learn
You are what you eat
You can have too much of a good thing
You can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink
You cannot have your cake and eat it too
You cannot get blood out of a stone
You cannot make a silk purse from a sow's ear
You cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs
You cannot make bricks without straw
You cannot run with the hare and hunt with the hounds
You cannot teach an old dog new tricks
You cannot judge a book by its cover
You cannot win them all
You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar
You pay your money and you take your choice
Youth is wasted on the young
You must have rocks in your head
